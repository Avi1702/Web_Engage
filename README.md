`My Request to the Account Manager`

Subject : Update on Task 

Dear Account Manager,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that the expected delivery date for Task you have given is going to be impacted `due to a family emergency` that I am currently dealing with.

I understand the importance of delivering the task on time and the hard work that goes into ensuring that we meet our deadlines. I deeply regret that I will not be able to meet the expected delivery date for this task, and I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. I know that this will likely have an impact on the rest of the project timeline and I want to assure you that I am doing everything in my power to resolve this situation as quickly as possible.

In the meantime, I would like to request your support in finding alternative solutions to help keep the project moving forward. If there is anyone on the team who can assist with some of the tasks, or if there is any other way that I can support the team from my current situation, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I will be available for updates and to answer any questions you may have.

If you don't find any alternative solution then I would like to request you to extend the due date `3 days` ahead if possible.

Once again, I apologize for the inconvenience and I appreciate your understanding during this difficult time.

Best regards,
Avinash Kumar Ray
